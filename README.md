distribute and install perl scripts to distribute files to multiple hosts and install them.

Current version of distribute.pl from 14 August 2025.
Current version of install.pl from 6 August 2025.

Intended primarily for OpenBSD hosts that use immutable file systems.

Also uses Signify.pm and syslock/sysunlock; I use it with rrsync (in my rsync-tools repo).
