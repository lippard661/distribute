distribute and install perl scripts to distribute files to multiple hosts and install them.

Current version of distribute.pl from 14 September 2025.
Current version of distribute.conf from 14 September 2025.
Current version of install.pl from 15 September 2025.

Intended primarily for OpenBSD hosts that use immutable file systems.

Also uses Signify.pm and syslock/sysunlock; I use it with rrsync (in my rsync-tools repo).
Signify.pm now supports Linux when used with the signify-openbsd apt package.
